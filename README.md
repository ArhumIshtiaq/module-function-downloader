Since I am trying to learn more about Python modules to improve my programs' functionalities. I find the Offical Python Documentation to be a great resource to get started with.

But, with some modules having well above 100 functions, I find it tedious to keep visiting the Official Python Documentation website and read a part of the documentation page, only to repeat the same process for the remaining part and with my recent troubles with having a consistent internet connection, I decided to take matters in my hands and try to make myself an offline document with prettily formatted conetents of each of the modules I was learning about.

Now, there are a couple of kinks that I need to work out: I need a way to save the functions' arguments and have the document save itself as a pretty PDF. I will periodically update it all as soon as I come up with a solution or the knowledge to fix it all. 

The script mainly uses <i><b>BeautifulSoup</b></i> to get it's data from the website and the rest is done using <b><i>requests</i></b> and <i><b>time</b></i> (<i><b>time</b></i> is only used to provide a better 'user experience').
